## How It's Made:

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JS, Nodes.js, Express, MongoDB

This project was built using Node.js, Express and EJS (Embedded Javascript Templating) for more dynamic programming.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was helpful in understanding the capabilites of CRUD apps and what can be done with the power of a backend and MongoDB. After completing this project, I feel more comfortable working with templating languages. I would like to implement more features that update the database.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:2023`
